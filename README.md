# simple-bitmap
Very simple functions for bitmap creation, manipulation and saving

This is my first (public) GitHub repo.

## Documentation
Will come eventually (or never)

## Simple bitmap 2.0 is in development
- has better API
- Will eventually support more Bitmap types
- May support other image types in the future
### I will upload it once it reached a mostly stable state
