# simple-bitmap
Very simple functions for bitmap creation, manipulation and saving

This is my first (public) GitHub repo.

## Documentation
Will come eventually (or never)

## Simple bitmap 2.0 is ~~in development~~ available
- has better API 
- ~~Will eventually~~ Does support more Bitmap types
- ~~Might~~ Will support other image types in the future
